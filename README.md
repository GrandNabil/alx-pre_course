**GIT PROJECT**
The git basics project is the first step towards my engineering degree. In the project I also learn to use github like the professionals. 
At the end of this project I will be able to know better what git and github are, talk about directories, how to create them and all the changes you can make to them and be able to configure git for the start of any project that requires github.
